This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

ESP example:

Out of 100, 62 individuals correctly predicted the card on their forehead. 

Null hypothesis: p =  0.5
n = 100



*Null hypothesis*
```{r}
r <- rbinom(n = 10000, size = 100, prob = 0.5)
hist(r)
```



How many people have scored above 60?
```{r}
pbinom(q = 63, size = 100,prob = 0.5,lower.tail = FALSE)
```


How many have scored below 40? 

```{r}
pbinom(q = 36, size = 100,prob = 0.5)

```
Overall including those below 40 and above 59, we have 0.028+0.028 = 0.056 or ~ 5.6% of the individuals.

That means under the 5% type-1 error criterion, as long as the number of individuals is between 40 and 59, we still cannot reject the Null hypothesis.

But at 62, we can! 


How can we directly test this? 
*Binomial Test in R*

```{r}
binom.test( x=62, n=100, p=.5 )



```

*Power Analysis in R*


```{r}
library(pwr)
pwr.p.test(h = ES.h(p1 = 0.75, p2 = 0.5),
           sig.level = 0.05,
           power = 0.80,
           alternative = "greater")
```
```{r}
pwr.p.test(n = 100,
           sig.level = 0.001,
           power = 0.80,
           alternative = "greater")
```

```{r}
ES.h(p1 = 0.95, p2 = 0.5)
```
git config user.email "arjunr@iitk.ac.in"
git config user.name "Arjun"


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
